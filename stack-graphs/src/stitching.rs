//! Partial paths can be "stitched together" to produce name-binding paths.
//!
//! The "path stitching" algorithm defined in this module is how we take a collection of [partial
//! paths][] and use them to build up name-binding paths.  Our conjecture is that by building paths
//! this way, we can precompute a useful amount of work at _index time_ (when we construct the
//! partial paths), to reduce the amount of work that needs to be done at _query time_ (when those
//! partial paths are stitched together into paths).
//!
//! Complicating this story is that for large codebases (especially those with many upstream and
//! downstream dependencies), there is a _very_ large set of partial paths available to us.  We
//! want to be able to load those in _lazily_, during the execution of the path-stitching
//! algorithm.
//!
//! The [`Database`][] and [`PathStitcher`][] types provide this functionality.  `Database`
//! manages a collection of partial paths that have been loaded into this process from some
//! external data store.  `PathStitcher` implements the path-stitching algorithm in _phases_.
//! During each phase, we will process a set of (possibly incomplete) paths, looking in the
//! `Database` for the set of partial paths that are compatible with those paths.  It is your
//! responsibility to make sure that the database contains all of possible extensions of the paths
//! that we're going to process in that phase.  For the first phase, you already know which
//! paths you're starting the search from, and must make sure that the database starts out
//! containing the possible extensions of those "seed" paths.  For subsequent phases, you get to
//! see which paths will be processed in the _next_ phase as part of handling the _current_ phase.
//! This gives you the opporunity to load additional partial paths into the `Database` before
//! allowing the next phase to proceed.
